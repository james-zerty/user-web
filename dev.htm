                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_FoxPro">Visual FoxPro</a> is a discontinued data-centric, 
                        object-oriented, procedural, programming language produced by
                        Microsoft. It was derived from FoxPro (originally known as FoxBASE) which was developed by Fox Software
                        beginning in 1984. Fox Technologies merged with Microsoft in 1992, after which the software acquired further
                        features and the prefix "Visual". FoxPro 2.6 worked on Mac OS, DOS, Windows, and Unix. Visual FoxPro 3.0, the
                        first "Visual" version, reduced platform support to only Mac and Windows, and later versions 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9
                        were Windows-only. The current version of Visual FoxPro is COM-based and Microsoft has stated that they do
                        not intend to create a Microsoft .NET version.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Visual FoxPro, commonly abbreviated as VFP, is tightly integrated with its own relational database engine,
                        which extends FoxPro's xBase capabilities to support SQL query and data manipulation. Unlike most database
                        management systems, Visual FoxPro is a full-featured, dynamic programming language that does not require the
                        use of an additional general-purpose programming environment. It can be used to write not just traditional
                        "fat client" applications, but also middleware and web applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Version 9.0, released in 2004 and updated in 2007, is the final version of the product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Visual FoxPro originated as a member of the class of languages commonly referred to as "xBase" languages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other members of the xBase language family include Clipper and Recital.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In late 2002, it was demonstrated that Visual FoxPro can run on Linux under the Wine Windows compatibility
                        suite. In 2003, this led to complaints by Microsoft.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was claimed that the deployment of runtime FoxPro code on non-Windows machines violates the End User 
                        License Agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Visual FoxPro had a rapid rise and fall in popularity as measured by the TIOBE Programming Community Index.
                        In December 2005, VFP broke into the top 20 for the first time. In June 2006 it peaked at position 12, making
                        it (at the time) a "B" language. By September 2010, FoxPro and its variants had fallen out of the top 50, where
                        it has remained ever since.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In March 2007, Microsoft announced that there will be no VFP 10, thus making VFP9 (released to manufacturing
                        on December 17, 2004) the last commercial VFP release from Microsoft. The support of Version 9 ended on December 31, 2015.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the time of the end of life announcement, work on the next release codenamed Sedna (named after a recently
                        discovered dwarf planet) which was built on top of the VFP9 codebase had already begun. "Sedna" is a set of
                        add-ons to VFP 9.0 of xBase components to support a number of interoperability scenarios with various Microsoft
                        technologies including SQL Server 2005, .NET Framework, Windows Vista, Office 2007, Windows Search and Team
                        Foundation Server (TFS). Microsoft released Sedna under the Shared source license on the CodePlex site. 
                        Microsoft has clarified that the VFP core will still remain closed source. Sedna was released on January 25,
                        2008. As of March 2008, all xBase components of the VFP 9 SP2 (including Sedna) were available for 
                        community-development on CodePlex.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In late March 2007 a grassroots campaign was started by the Spanish-speaking FoxPro community at MásFoxPro 
                        ("MoreFoxPro" in English) to sign a petition to Microsoft to continue updating Visual FoxPro or release it to
                        the community as Open Source. On April 3, 2007 the movement was noted by the technical press.
                        On April 3, 2007, Microsoft responded to the petition with this statement from Alan Griver:
                        "We're very aware of the FoxPro community and that played a large part in what we announced on March 13th. It's
                        never an easy decision to announce that we're not going to release another version of a product and it's one
                        that we consider very carefully.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "We're not announcing the end of FoxPro: Obviously, FoxPro applications will continue to work. By some of our
                        internal estimates, there are more applications running in FoxPro 2.6 than there are in VFP and FoxPro 2.6
                        hasn't been supported in many years. Visual FoxPro 9 will be supported by Microsoft through 2015.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "For Microsoft to continue to evolve the FoxPro base, we would need to look at creating a 64-bit development
                        environment and that would involve an almost complete rewrite of the core product. We've also invested in 
                        creating a scalable database with SQL Server, including the freely available SQL Server Express Edition. As 
                        far as forming a partnership with a third-party is concerned, we've heard from a number of large FoxPro 
                        customers that this would make it impossible for them to continue to use FoxPro since it would no longer 
                        be from an approved vendor. We felt that putting the environment into open source on CodePlex, which 
                        balances the needs of both the community and the large customers, was the best path forward."

                        On a summer day in the <a href="#">San Joaquin Valley</a>, 101 in the shade, I merge onto Highway 99 past downtown Fresno
                        and steer through the vibrations of heat. I’m headed to the valley’s deep south, to a little farmworker
                        town in a far corner of Kern County called Lost Hills. This is where the biggest irrigated farmer in the
                        world — the one whose mad plantings of almonds and pistachios have triggered California’s nut rush — keeps
                        on growing, no matter drought or flood. He doesn’t live in Lost Hills. He lives in Beverly Hills. How has
                        he managed to outwit nature for so long?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The GPS tells me to take Interstate 5, the fastest route through the belly of the state, but I’m partial
                        to Highway 99, the old road that brought the Okies and Mexicans to the fields and deposited a twang on my
                        Armenian tongue. The highway runs two lanes here, three lanes there, through miles of agriculture broken
                        every 20 minutes by fast food, gas station, and cheap motel. Tracts of houses, California’s last
                        affordable dream, civilize three or four exits, and then it’s back to the open road splattered with the
                        guts and feathers of chickens that jumped ship on the slaughterhouse drive. Pink and white oleanders
                        divide the highway, and every third vehicle that whooshes by is a big rig. More often than not, it is
                        hauling away some piece of the valley’s bounty. The harvest begins in January with one type of mandarin
                        and ends in December with another type of mandarin and in between spills forth everything in your
                        supermarket produce and dairy aisles except for bananas and mangoes, though the farmers here are working
                        on the tropical, too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I stick to the left lane and try to stay ahead of the pack. The big-rig drivers are cranky two ways,
                        and the farmworkers in their last-leg vans are half-asleep. Ninety-nine is the deadliest highway in
                        America. Deadly in the rush of harvest, deadly in the quiet of fog, deadly in the blur of Saturday
                        nights when the fieldwork is done and the beer drinking becomes a second humiliation. Twenty miles
                        outside Fresno, I cross the Kings, the river that irrigates more farmland than any other river here.
                        The Kings is bone-dry as usual. To find its flow, I’d have to go looking in a thousand irrigation
                        ditches in the fields beyond.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid (Spain) found that the
                        English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        In comparison, the project lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to 
                        such content among the reasons for this trend.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There’s a mountain range to my left and a mountain range to my right and in between a plain flatter
                        than Kansas where crop and sky meet. One of the most dramatic alterations of the earth’s surface in
                        human history took place here. The hillocks that existed back in Yokut Indian days were flattened by
                        a hunk of metal called the Fresno Scraper. Every river busting out of the Sierra was bent sideways,
                        if not backward, by a bulwark of ditches, levees, canals, and dams. The farmer corralled the snowmelt
                        and erased the valley, its desert and marsh. He leveled its hog wallows, denuded its salt brush, and
                        killed the last of its mustang, antelope, and tule elk. He emptied the sky of tens of millions of
                        geese and drained the 800 square miles of Tulare Lake dry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He did this first in the name of wheat and then beef, milk, raisins, cotton, and nuts. Once he finished
                        grabbing the flow of the five rivers that ran across the plain, he used his turbine pumps to seize the
                        water beneath the ground. As he bled the aquifer dry, he called on the government to bring him an even
                        mightier river from afar. Down the great aqueduct, by freight of politics and gravity, came the excess
                        waters of the Sacramento River. The farmer moved the rain. The more water he got, the more crops he
                        planted, and the more crops he planted, the more water he needed to plant more crops, and on and on.
                        One million acres of the valley floor, greater than the size of Rhode Island, are now covered in almond
                        trees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I pity the outsider trying to make sense of it. My grandfather, a survivor of the Armenian genocide,
                        traveled 7,000 miles by ship and train in 1920 to find out if his uncle’s exhortation — “The grapes
                        here are the size of jade eggs” — was true. My father, born in a vineyard outside Fresno, was a raisin
                        grower before he became a bar owner. I grew up in the suburbs where our playgrounds were named after
                        the pioneers of fruit and canals of irrigation shot through our neighborhoods to the farms we did not
                        know. For half my life, I never stopped to wonder: How much was magic? How much was plunder?

                        process. <a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news">Nupedia was founded on March 9, 2000</a>, under the ownership
                        of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were the Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger,
                        editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was licensed initially under its own Nupedia
                        Open Content License, switching to the GNU Free Documentation License before Wikipedia's founding at the
                        urging of Richard Stallman. Sanger and Wales founded Wikipedia. While Wales is credited with defining
                        the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia, Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a
                        wiki to reach that goal. On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a
                        wiki as a "feeder" project for Nupedia.

                        Wikipedia was formally launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English-language edition at
                        www.wikipedia.com, and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. Wikipedia's policy of
                        "neutral point-of-view" was codified in its first months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules
                        initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia. Originally, Bomis intended to make
                        Wikipedia a business for profit.

                        Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine
                        indexing. By August 8, 2001, Wikipedia had over 8,000 articles. On September 25, 2001, Wikipedia had
                        over 13,000 articles. And by the end of 2001 it had grown to approximately 20,000 articles and 18
                        language editions. It had reached 26 language editions by late 2002, 46 by the end of 2003, and 161
                        by the final days of 2004. Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken
                        down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. English Wikipedia passed the
                        mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever
                        assembled, surpassing even the 1408 Yongle Encyclopedia, which had held the record for almost 600
                        years.

                        Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia, users of the Spanish
                        Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002. These moves
                        encouraged Wales to announce that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and to change
                        Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.

                        Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the
                        edition, in terms of the numbers of articles and of contributors, appears to have peaked around
                        early 2007. Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average
                        was roughly 800. A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to the
                        project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change. Others suggest that the growth is
                        flattening naturally because articles that could be called "low-hanging fruit"—topics that clearly
                        merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.

                    <p> 
                        Two years later, Wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline, noting a decrease from "a little
                        more than 36,000 writers" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, Wales also
                        claimed the number of editors was "stable and sustainable", a claim which was questioned by MIT's
                        Technology Review in a 2013 article titled "The Decline of Wikipedia." In July 2012, the Atlantic
                        reported that the number of administrators is also in decline. In the November 25, 2013, issue of
                        New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated "Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an
                        internal crisis. In 2013, MIT's Technology Review revealed that since 2007, the site has lost a
                        third of the volunteer editors who update and correct the online encyclopedia's millions of pages
                        and those still there have focused increasingly on minutiae."

                    Version 9.0, released in 2004 and updated in 2007, is the final version of the product.

                    Visual FoxPro originated as a member of the class of languages commonly referred to as "xBase" languages,
                    which have syntax based on the dBase programming language. Other members of the xBase language family include Clipper and Recital.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Visual FoxPro, commonly abbreviated as VFP, is tightly integrated with its own relational database engine,
                    which extends FoxPro's xBase capabilities to support SQL query and data manipulation. Unlike most database
                    management systems, Visual FoxPro is a full-featured, dynamic programming language that does not require the
                    use of an additional general-purpose programming environment. It can be used to write not just traditional
                    "fat client" applications, but also middleware and web applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In late 2002, it was demonstrated that Visual FoxPro can run on Linux under the Wine Windows compatibility
                    suite. In 2003, this led to complaints by Microsoft: it was claimed that the deployment of runtime FoxPro code
                    on non-Windows machines violates the End User License Agreement.
